Conclusions provided by the articles:

1) In United States, the median estimate for the prevalence of depression is higher for women than for men. 
3) Globally, older individuals (in the 70 years and older age bracket) have a higher risk of depression relative to other age groups.
4) Sleeping problems and low energy are the most common symptoms in people diagnosed with moderate or severe depression.

**Analysis of first conclusion:**
The below image is from the article where prevalence is more in females:

We replicate the data to check the method we will use for analysis:

As it can be seen from the above visualizations, the conclusion from the article that says depression is more prevalent in females is true.
