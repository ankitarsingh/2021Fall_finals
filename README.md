In the above articles, there are visualizations depicting prevalence of disorder, different types of disorders related to depression, recovery rates, and suicides caused due to it.

In the above article, the author analyzes data of anxiety disorder rates and suicide rates and provides statistics.

Suicide data dataset link: https://ourworldindata.org/suicide

Conclusions provided by the articles:

1) In United States, the median estimate for the prevalence of depression is higher for women than for men. 
2) Globally, older individuals (in the 70 years and older age bracket) have a higher risk of depression relative to other age groups.
3) Anxiety ddisorders and suicides are independently related to each other.
**Analysis of first conclusion:**
The below image is from the article where prevalence is more in females:

We replicate the data to check the method we will use for analysis:

Now, lets check the prevalence using barplots:

Also, according to data.world dataset, the table clearly shows the statitics:

As it can be seen from the above visualizations, the conclusion from the article that says depression is more prevalent in females is true.

**Analysis of third conclusion: Global Anxiety disorder and suicide rate relation**

Upon analyzing the line charts and correlation plots, the results showed that countries like ‘USA’ showed a mild negative correlation of -0.37 between anxiety disorder rate and suicide rate.  Afghanistan showed a strong positive correlation of 0.98 between both the variables. Albania showed a moderate positive correlation of 0.61. American Samoa showed a strong negative correlation of -0.92. Likewise, very country showed various correlations between anxiety disorder rate and suicide rate.

Talking about the positive correlation, American Samoa shows strong correlation of anxiety disorder rate and suicide rate i.e., there was a high percentage of people who had anxiety disorder that committed suicide.  While there was also an example of Afghanistan, which showed the opposite results with high negative correlation. 
From the analysis we found that anxiety disorder and suicide rate is not necessarily associated with each other in every country. Some countries dataset showed trends that deny the conclusion derived in the article, while some countries supported the conclusion. This shows that there will be some other factors apart from anxiety disorder, that influence suicides in countries.
