In the above article, the author analyzes data of anxiety disorder rates and suicide rates and provides statistics.

Anxiety disorder dataset link: https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health#anxiety-disorders
Suicide data dataset link: https://ourworldindata.org/suicide

Conclusions provided by the articles:

1) In United States, the median estimate for the prevalence of depression is higher for women than for men. 
2) Globally, older individuals (in the 70 years and older age bracket) have a higher risk of depression relative to other age groups.
3) Anxiety ddisorders and suicides are independently related to each other.


**Analysis of first conclusion:**

The below image is from the article where prevalence is more in females:

We replicate the data to check the method we will use for analysis:

Now, lets check the prevalence using barplots:

Also, according to data.world dataset, the table clearly shows the statitics:

As it can be seen from the above visualizations, the conclusion from the article that says depression is more prevalent in females is true.

**ANALYSIS of 2nd conclusion to check prevalence of depression and to check if global prevalence of depression is more in people of age above**
**performed by SUPRIYA JAYADEV HIREMATH**

There are different kinds of depressive disorders like Persistent Depressive Disorder(Dysthymia), Bipolar Disorder, Major Depression, Anxious distress(anxiety disorder)
(For more information about the types of depressive disorders refer https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-types)

1) Checking if the prevalence of depression in our analysis matches with the numbers stated by the article.
Our research paper states that, the share of the population with depression ranges mostly between 2% and 6% around the world today.

Analysis:
We considered a dataset with five main regions in the world i.e Africa, America, Asia, Oceania, Europe and plotted  two different graphs one with just prevalence of major depression disorder  and another one with prevalence of all four different kinds of depressive disorders in these same five regions (as mentioned above).

Inference:
Average prevalence percentage ranges from 2.4 in Oceania to 5.07 in Africa considering just major depressive disorder.
Average prevalence percentage ranges from 2.1 in Asia to 3.13 in America considering all mental health disorders.

Conclusion:
Since research paper values almost match with ranges derived from just major depressive dataset, it is possible that research paper did not include various kinds of depressive disorders but instead focused their study mainly on Major depression unlike they mentioned in their description.(statement in our research paper: “The data presented below includes all forms of depression across this spectrum.”)

2)Checking in which age group depression is more prevalent.

According to the research paper, globally older individuals(in 70 years and older age) have higher risk of depression relative to other age groups.

Analysis:
We considered our main dataset and plotted graph for four different regions: America, Oceania, Asia and one for global.

Inference:
We observed that in Asia depression in seniors (age above 70) is more prevalent when compared to youths and adults(age below 70), however trends for America and Oceania showed that depression was more prevalent in youths rather than older people.

Conclusion:
We can see in our plot for global data that prevalence of depression is more in people with age above 70, which agrees with the research paper study. However it is not true for all individual regions. When we see trends for each region we can see that there are countries where youths are suffering more from depression rather than senior adults from the past three decades.

3)Analysing what factors are leading to higher prevalence of depression in youths in regions.

Analysis:
There are many lifestyle factors that lead to depression in youth like stress, social media usage, substance and drug use, poor diet etc. We have chosen social media usage and will be analysing trends in factors like substance and alcohol use, social media usage over the time in particular regions.
   a) Substance and Drug use as a contributor in America and Oceania.
   
   Inference:
   In our (2)analysis we could see that prevalence over the time has increased in America but decreased in Oceania for youths in particular.
   Here in this analysis we can see that substance and drug use disorders for youths in America have increased, and the trend for Oceania has remained almost          constant.
   
   Conclusion:
   We can say that alcohol and drug usage by youth might have been a strong contributor along with other factors in America.
   Whereas in Oceania, we can say that substance and drug usage might not have been a strong contributor, there might be other factors that must have contributed      to depression in youths.
   
   b) Social Media usage as a contributor to depression in American youths.
   
   Inference:
   In our plot of analysis(2), we saw that the prevalence of depression in youth was highest during the time period ranging from 2006 to 2011, and here in this        analysis of social media usage by american youths, we see that trends increased with a great speed from around 12%  in 2006 to around 80 % in 2013, and after      2013 we can see that social media usage remained at around 80% usage with few occasional dips but these dips and raises after 2013 ranges between 80% to 90%.
   
   Conclusion:
   Both social media usage and prevalence of depression in youth in America saw an increase during the same time period, we can say that social media might be a      strongest contributor of depression in youth in America.


**Analysis of third conclusion: Global Anxiety disorder and suicide rate relation**
** performed by BRijesh Taunk** 

Upon analyzing the line charts and correlation plots, the results showed that countries like ‘USA’ showed a mild negative correlation of -0.37 between anxiety disorder rate and suicide rate.  Afghanistan showed a strong positive correlation of 0.98 between both the variables. Albania showed a moderate positive correlation of 0.61. American Samoa showed a strong negative correlation of -0.92. Likewise, very country showed various correlations between anxiety disorder rate and suicide rate.

Talking about the positive correlation, American Samoa shows strong correlation of anxiety disorder rate and suicide rate i.e., there was a high percentage of people who had anxiety disorder that committed suicide.  While there was also an example of Afghanistan, which showed the opposite results with high negative correlation. 
From the analysis we found that anxiety disorder and suicide rate is not necessarily associated with each other in every country. Some countries dataset showed trends that deny the conclusion derived in the article, while some countries supported the conclusion. This shows that there will be some other factors apart from anxiety disorder, that influence suicides in countries.
